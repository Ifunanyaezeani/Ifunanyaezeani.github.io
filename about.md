## About me

Hello everyone, I am an IT(information technology) student who began studying in spring 2021. I am 20 years of age and the second child and first daughter of my family. I am an identical twin, I currently don’t specialize in any fields right now. I’m still open to learning more skills and specialize in a field soon enough. I am a Nigerian, from Anambra state. I am currently in my 3rd year second semester, I enjoy web designing and programming. I’m more of a front end developer, not really familiar with Back end developing. I’d say I’m a hardworking, resilient and smart student I’m a great team member and possibly a leader too. I love animals, dogs especially, I don’t have any pets. I love swimming, sleeping, cooking and watching movies, horror precisely.
